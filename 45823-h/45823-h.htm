<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Whether this little volume will find sufficient
patrons to defray the cost of its production is at least doubtful. The
writer whose essays it contains lived in obscurity and will never be
popular. But he possessed a fine intellect, however frustrated by
circumstances; he belonged to an illustrious family; and it is well to
let the public have access to the opinions of a brother of Cardinal
Newman and of Professor Newman, a brother who took his own course, as
they did, and thought out for himself an independent philosophy.</p>
<p>All Charles Robert Newman&rsquo;s writings that are known to have
been printed, appeared in the Reasoner, edited by Mr. George Jacob
Holyoake, at various dates during 1860&ndash;61. With trifling
exceptions they are all reprinted in this collection.</p>
<p>Mr. Holyoake has kindly supplied a brief account of the atheistic
Newman, and Mr. J. M. Wheeler has gathered all the information that is
obtainable as to his life and personality. <span class=

<h2 class="main">BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of Charles Robert Newman, until the death of his
brother, the Cardinal, almost nothing was known. Some reminiscences of
him by Mr. Thomas Purnell and Precentor Edmund Venables appeared in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> at the time of his death in 1884, and these
remain the chief sources of information concerning him. Mr. G. J.
Holyoake also, in his paper <i>The Present Day</i>, wrote: &ldquo;If
the public come to know more of Charles R. Newman, it will be seen that
all the brothers, John Henry, Francis William, and Charles R. Newman,
were men of unusual distinction of character, and that while each held
diverse views, all had the family qualities of perspicacity, candor and
conscience.&rdquo; But these notes attracted little attention. Most
people were under the impression there were only two brothers, who had
long figured in the public eye as types of the opposite courses of
modern thought towards Romanism and Rationalism. Yet the real type of
antagonism to Rome was to be found in Charles Robert, who is dismissed
by the Rev. Thomas Mozley with the words: &ldquo;There was also another
brother, not without his share in the heritage of natural
gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a notable passage on change of religion, in his <i>Essay in Aid
of a Grammar of Assent</i>, chap. vii., Cardinal Newman seems to allude
to the career of himself and his brothers. He says: &ldquo;Thus of
three Protestants, one becomes a Catholic, a second a Unitarian, and a
third an unbeliever: how is this? The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>first becomes a Catholic,
because he assented, as a Protestant, to the doctrine of our
Lord&rsquo;s divinity, with a real assent and a genuine conviction, and
because this certitude, taking possession of his mind, led him on to
welcome the Catholic doctrines of the Real Presence and of the
Theotocos, till his Protestantism fell off from him, and he submitted
himself to the Church. The second became a Unitarian, because,
proceeding on the principle that Scripture was the rule of faith, and
that a man&rsquo;s private judgment was its rule of interpretation, and
finding that the doctrine of the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds did not
follow by logical necessity from the text of Scripture, he said to
himself, &lsquo;The word of God has been made of none effect by the
traditions of men,&rsquo; and therefore nothing was left for him but to
profess what he considered primitive Christianity and to become a
Humanitarian. The third gradually subsided into infidelity, because he
started with the Protestant dogma, cherished in the depths of his
nature, that a priesthood was a corruption of the simplicity of the
Gospel. First, then, he would protest against the sacrifice of the
Mass; next he gave up baptismal regeneration and the sacramental
principle; then he asked himself whether dogmas were not a restraint on
Christian liberty as well as Sacraments; then came the question, What
after all was the use of teachers of religion? Why should any one stand
between him and his Maker? After a time it struck him that this obvious
question had to be answered by the Apostles, as well as by the Anglican
clergy; so he came to the conclusion that the true and only revelation
of God to man is that which is written on the heart. This did for a
time, and he remained a Deist. But then it occurred to him, that this
inward moral law was there within the breast, whether there was a God
or not, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>it was a roundabout way of enforcing that law, to
say that it came from God and simply unnecessary, considering it
carried with it its own sacred and sovereign authority, as our feelings
instinctively testified, and when he turned to look at the physical
world around him, he really did not see what scientific proof there was
of the Being of God at all, and it seemed to him as if all things would
go quite as well as at present without that hypothesis as with it; so
he dropped it, and became a <i lang="la">purus putus</i>
Atheist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have transcribed this lengthy, but remarkable passage, not because
I think it correctly describes the process of thought in his two
brothers, but rather as an illustration that his own imaginative
synthesis of their position derives its life and force from the fact
that he had before him concrete instances in the person of his own
nearest relatives.</p>
<p>Charles Robert Newman, younger brother of the Cardinal and elder
brother of the Professor, was born on June 16, 1802, being one year and
four months the junior of the former, and three years the senior of the
latter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e209src" href="#xd21e209" name=
"xd21e209src">1</a> Their father, a London man, and friend of Capel the
eminent stockbroker, from having been clerk in a bank, became a
partner, though he afterwards failed at a time of great commercial
depression, both in this business and as a brewer. He was a Freemason,
a musician, and had schemes of social improvement by reclaiming waste
land and planting with trees. In religion his views appear to have been
of a broad cast approximating to those of Benjamin Franklin. The
mother, whose maiden name was Jemima Fourdrinier, was of Hugenot
family, and of religious cast of mind. There were six children, equally
divided as to sex. Harriet, the eldest girl, married the Rev.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>Thomas Mozley; Jemima, the second, married Mr.
John Mozley; while Mary, the youngest, died unmarried.</p>
<p>Charles Robert was educated at the same school as his two brothers,
John Henry and Francis William, that of Dr. George Nicholas at Ealing,
Middlesex.</p>
<p>Of the influences which moulded his mind we can only speak from what
is known of his brothers. John Henry has told how, in youth, he read
Paine&rsquo;s tracts against the Old Testament&mdash;we presume he
means the <i>Age of Reason</i>&mdash;and also boasted of reading Hume,
though, as he says, this was possibly but by way of brag.</p>
<p>Evidently, though the family was brought up in the habit of Bible
reading, there was considerable freedom allowed as to the direction of
their studies. While the father lived family prayer was unknown, nor
was there any inculcation of dogma. &ldquo;We read,&rdquo; says Francis
William, &ldquo;the Psalms appointed by the church every day, and went
to the parish church on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis William Newman, in his &ldquo;Contributions, Chiefly to the
Early History of Cardinal Newman,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;In opening life,
my brother C. R. N. became a convert to Robert Owen, the philanthropic
Socialist, who was <i>then</i> an Atheist.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e231src" href="#xd21e231" name="xd21e231src">2</a> But soon
breaking loose from him, Charles tried to originate a &lsquo;New Moral
World&rsquo; of his own, which seemed to others absurd and immoral, as
well as very unamiable. He disowned us all, on my father&rsquo;s death,
as &lsquo;too religious for him.&rsquo; To keep a friend, or to act
under a superior, seemed alike impossible to him. His brother (the late
Cardinal) humbled himself to beg a clerkship for him in the Bank of
England; but Charles thought it &lsquo;his duty&rsquo; to write to the
Directors letters of advice, so they could <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>not keep
him. Nor could he keep any place long. He said he ought to take a
literary degree at Bonn: his two brothers managed it for him, but he
came away <i>without</i> seeking the degree. His brother-in-law, the
Rev<span class="corr" id="xd21e239" title="Source: ,">.</span> Thomas
Mozley, then took him up very liberally; but after my sister
Harriet&rsquo;s death, J. H. N. and I bore his expenses to his dying
day. His meanness seemed to me like that of an old cynic; yet his
moderation was exemplary, and at last he undoubtedly won the respect of
the mother and daughter who waited on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this, which is nearly all he has to say of this elder brother, it
appears to me Professor Newman has either said too little or too much.
The title of his work did not necessitate any reference to Charles
Robert; but having said so much he should at least have explained
further. For instance, in reference to the visit to Bonn, it was
exceedingly natural in the second brother seeking to take a degree,
since both his senior and junior had a college education. That he did
not share in this advantage may have well tended to sour his life. Mr.
Meynell explains why he returned without seeking the degree. He says:
&ldquo;But he came away without even offering himself for examination,
a step he explained by saying that the judges would not grant him a
degree because he had given offence by his treatment of faith and
morals [it is a Catholic who writes] in an essay which they call
<i>teterrima</i>.&rdquo; Charles may have acted with extreme
imprudence, both in regard to the bank directors and the Bonn
examiners; but we should need to know the cases before we can determine
whether he was actuated by wilful waywardness or by adherence to a
higher than common standard of conduct. Each of the brothers had
evidently exquisite sensitiveness of conscience, though, as proved by
the Professor&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>last book&mdash;that unique criticism of a
brother who died at ninety by another aged eighty-five&mdash;they could
not always enter into sympathy with each other.</p>
<p>Of this we may be quite sure. The life of one who had thought
himself into Atheism, yet contemplated becoming a tutor, must have been
a most uncomfortable one. The treatment he was likely to receive could
not be calculated to evoke his better qualities. Finding everywhere his
Atheism a bar to his advancement, whose is the fault if it resulted in
a character of petulance and cynicism, and in&mdash;what it evidently
did result in&mdash;a largely wasted life?</p>
<p>The Rev. Edward Venables, Precentor of Lincoln, speaks of him as
having been, between 1834 and 1844, usher in a large school for
farmers&rsquo; sons, kept by a Mr. Allfree at Windmill Hill, in the
parish of Herstmonceaux, Sussex, where Julius Charles Hare, Archdeacon
of Lewes, was rector, and John Sterling for a short while curate. Mr.
Venables says Newman &ldquo;interested Archdeacon Hare very much, and I
have often heard him speak of the long conversations he had had with
him on literary and philosophical subjects, and of the remarkable
mental power he displayed. At that time the future Cardinal&rsquo;s
brother had entirely discarded the Christian faith, and declared
himself an unbeliever in revelation.&rdquo; There can be no doubt the
tribute from Hare, a man of very superior culture, was deserved, though
the archdeacon also expressed the opinion &ldquo;there was a screw
loose somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The task of teaching the Sussex rustics was, as Precentor Venables
remarks, intolerably irksome to a man of Newman&rsquo;s high
intellectual power. It was like chopping logs with a fine-edged razor.
His relations with his principal became strained, and a tussle between
the usher and his class led to his dismissal. At this time he was
miserably poor. Precentor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>Venables says: &ldquo;To Hare he
lamented the narrow-mindedness of his brothers John and Francis, who,
as he asserted, had entirely cast him off, and left him to fight his
way in the world unaided, because of his professed infidelity, in which
the younger of the two, then an ardent Evangelical, was before very
long to follow him.&rdquo; No reproach whatever is due to the younger
brother on this account, and the elder is probably as little
blameworthy. John Henry could not be expected to recommend as tutor one
whose views upon faith and morals he considered unsound. Francis
William had gone to Bagdad with the object of assisting in a Christian
mission, and intercourse with Mohammedans and other studies were but
gradually loosening his orthodoxy. After his return, and when his works
and professorship at London University assured his position, he put
himself into regular monthly communication with his brother. In the
meantime he had been assisted by his sister Harriet&rsquo;s husband.
But the iron had already entered his soul; he was an Atheist and an
outcast. Forced to receive the bounty of relatives who deplored his
opinions, he seems to have resented their kindness as an attempt to
bribe his intellectual conscience. The world rang with the
fame&mdash;as theologian, historian, poet, and preacher&mdash;of the
elder, whose creed he had outgrown and despised; while his convictions,
to the full as honest, everywhere stood in his way, and were contemned
as an offence against faith and morals. He had no contact with minds
congenial to his own, and doomed himself to the life of a recluse.</p>
<p>Each of the brothers was of a retiring, meditative disposition.
Reading the <i>Apologia Pro Vita Sua</i> of the eldest, one may see how
this contributed towards his seeking a refuge in the Catholic Church.
The same disposition of mind may be traced in the <i>Phases
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>of Faith</i> of the youngest, equally impelling
him from the evangelicalism of his surroundings and leading to the
rejection of historic Christianity, and finally to the surrender of all
belief in revelation. In Charles Robert Newman the same qualities were
seen to excess, removing him from contact with his fellows to the life
of a solitary thinker in a quiet Welsh watering-place. From about 1853,
he had a room in a small cottage on the Marsh road, Tenby.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Purnell, who says he had for years &ldquo;the inestimable
privilege of enjoying his close intimacy,&rdquo; remarks, &ldquo;never
before or since have I met a man endowed with as rare an intellectual
equipment.&rdquo; Mr. Purnell thus describes his own first visit to the
recluse: &ldquo;He stood at the top of the topmost stair. I cannot
imagine a more distinguished head and face. There was a touch of
Mephistopheles in him. There was also a touch of Jupiter Olympius.
Although dressed in ill-fitting clothes, and with a sort of blanket
over his shoulders, he appeared to me to be the ideal of courtly grace.
He bowed me without a word into his apartments. This was in the roof of
the building, and the only light came from a window which opened with a
notched iron bar. The room was as meagrely furnished as Goethe&rsquo;s
study in Weimar. A bed, a chest of drawers, a table and two or three
chairs, with a few books, constituted the whole goods and
chattels.&rdquo; Mr. Purnell says &ldquo;his health, means and
inclination made him averse to society. The rector called on him, but
was not admitted; visitors to the town who had known his brothers would
send in their cards, but they received no response; local medical men,
when they heard he was ill, volunteered their services, but they were
declined with courteous thanks conveyed by letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears he but seldom left his house, and when he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>went out
he did not often enter the town, but took his exercise in the road
which led into the country. Dressed in a pea-jacket, with a shawl or a
rug thrown across his shoulders, and with a sou&rsquo;-wester over his
head, he marched erect, looking neither to left nor right. He wore
shoes, and, as his trousers were short, displayed an interval of white
socks. The lads and lasses were apt to regard such a figure with
derision.</p>
<p>It was through Mr. Purnell that he communicated the papers here
reprinted to the <i>Reasoner</i>. Although but of the character of
fragments, they bespeak an original mind. The secret of the
Cardinal&rsquo;s great influence and strength was that what he spoke
and wrote came not from books, but forthright out of his own head and
heart. The topics with which his brother deals were those only needing
the mind, and his treatment shows they were viewed in the dry light of
an original intellect. The <i>Reasoner</i> ceased soon after the
appearance of these papers, and thus closed the one opening for his
literary activity. Francis William Newman was, at least till the
present year, unaware that his arguments for Theism were challenged by
his own brother under the signature of &ldquo;A Recluse.&rdquo; He
informs me that he had never heard that anyone would publish anything
from his pen, and that he heard that at his death, in March, 1884, he
left a box full of manuscripts, which were destroyed as useless.
Whether this was done by order of his relatives, whether the landlady
decided the question, or whether the vicar or neighbors were called in,
will perhaps remain as unknown as the worth of the manuscripts. The
following specimens are all by which the latter question can be
judged.</p>
<p>Mr. Meynell says that two years before he died he had a short visit
from his eldest brother. It must have been a strange meeting, and one
worthy the brush of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>a great artist. Surely in all England there
were not two men of eighty whose thoughts were so divergent or two
brothers whose lives were so diversified. The one a saintly cardinal,
called by the Pope the Light of England, who, by his rare urbanity, had
gained the respect of all, replete with all that should accompany old
age&mdash;as honor, love, obedience, troops of friends: the other,
fallen, too, into the sere and yellow leaf, and without them
all&mdash;poor, solitary, unknown and despised, a scorn and wonderment
to his nearest neighbors. And all from following his own thought that
had made him a <i lang="la">purus putus</i> Atheist.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">CHARACTER OF CHARLES NEWMAN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is little to say and less need to add anything
to what Mr. Wheeler writes, whose industry and discernment collect
together all the accessible facts of his subject. My knowledge of
Charles Robert Newman is confined to his correspondence, which, with my
present engagements, I could not refer to and examine without delaying
the printer longer than would be convenient to you, as Mr.
Wheeler&rsquo;s article is in type. The impression Mr. C. R. Newman
conveyed to me by his letters is, I judge, sufficient for the purpose
in hand. Charles Newman had an intermittent mind. He would write with
great force and clearness, and in another letter, which was confused in
parts, he would frankly say that his mind was leaving him, as was its
wont as I understood him, and after a few months less or more, it would
return to him, when he would write again. In this manly frankness and
strong self-consciousness he resembled his two eminent brothers Francis
and John. I trusted to his friend Mr. Purnell, who was the medium in
communicating with me, to send me further letters when Mr. Charles was
able or disposed to write them. I expected to hear from him again. Much
occupied with debates and otherwise at the time, I neglected writing
further to him myself. Afterwards thinking his disablement might have
grown upon him with years, disinclined me from asking him to resume his
letters. Mr. Wheeler seems ignorant of Charles Newman&rsquo;s mental
peculiarity, and does not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>recognise what may be generous
delicacy on the part of his brothers in not referring to it. To do so
would have subjected them to the imputation, very frequent formerly, of
imputing difference of opinion to want of saneness. Even so liberal a
preacher as W. J. Fox accounted, in 1841, for my disbelief in Theism by
conjecturing the existence of some mental deficiency. No doubt many
persons with whom Charles Newman had dealings in offices he held, would
regard his Atheism&mdash;which it was contrary to his nature to
conceal&mdash;as a personal disqualification. He avowed his opinions as
naturally and as boldly as Professor Newman and the Cardinal avowed
theirs. It is not conceivable that Cardinal Newman ever intermitted his
aid&mdash;or Professor Newman either&mdash;on this account. They were
both incapable of personal intolerance. They might deplore that their
brother Charles&rsquo;s opinions were so alien, so contrary to theirs;
but this they would never make matter of reproach. It was doubtless a
great trial to them that their brother, having fine powers like their
own, making no persistent effort for his own maintenance, although he
knew it must render independence impossible. Possibly the solitariness
which he chose caused his tendency to unusualness of conduct, not to
say eccentricity, to grow upon him&mdash;which they could not control
or mitigate without an interference, which might subject them to
resentment and reproach. Charles no doubt inherited his father&rsquo;s
sympathy for social improvement, which led to his sharing Robert
Owen&rsquo;s sociologic views. But he did not acquire his Atheism from
Robert Owen&mdash;as Professor Newman has said&mdash;for Robert Owen
was not an Atheist&mdash;always believing in some Great Power.</p>
<p>Professor Newman has told me that in any further edition of his
little book upon his brother, the Cardinal, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>he will,
on my authority, correct his description of Robert Owen as an Atheist.
Charles owed his Atheism to himself, as his brothers owed their
opinions to their own conclusions and reflections. Charles not taking a
degree was less likely to be owing to means not being furnished to him
than to his intermittent indecision of mind and his strong discernment,
which produced satisfaction with the world, with others, and with
himself.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">TWO PRINCIPLES OF ORDER.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In my proof of the invalidity of that
argument&mdash;it being indeed what is called &ldquo;the Argument from
Design&rdquo;&mdash;I point out that our experience simultaneously
informs us of two modes of producing order, otherwise called
arrangement, relation of parts to each other and to the whole direction
of means towards some recognisable end; or, to describe the phenomenon
in the most summary, as well as the most practical, way&mdash;two modes
of producing effects identical with those that proceed from design. I
explain that, of these two principles of order, the one is Design
itself, a <i>modus operandi</i> of intelligence (such as we find it
here below, of which the human mind affords the best examples), while
the other is something to which no name has been assigned, and which,
consequently, we can only shortly describe by saying that it is
<i>not</i> design. It becomes necessary, therefore, to give a farther
periphrastic account of it as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>This nameless principle of order, considered as a vague popular
surmise, is as familiar to our experience as design. We all see, for
instance, that water has a tendency to form a perfectly level and
horizontal surface, that heavy bodies fall to the earth
perpendicularly, that the plummet performs a straight line in just the
same direction, that dew-drops and soap-bubbles <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>assume a
globular shape, that crystallisation observes similar artist-like
rules, and so on. We are accustomed to say, &ldquo;It is the nature of
things,&rdquo; and we ground our daily actions on a confidence in this
regularity of proceeding, without generally attempting to explain it.
Science comes to our help, and shows us that this orderly action of
things around us may be traced to, and is the necessary result of, the
operation of certain powers or properties inherent in these natural
things. Grant that the property called gravitation belongs to moving
bodies, and an innumerable quantity of orderly phenomena may be
predicated as springing of their own accord by inevitable consequence
from this datum; which same phenomena, moreover, intelligence is able
coincidently to reproduce in its own special mental way.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a principle of order, less popularly appreciated, but
not less certainly evidenced and known, than design. It is, no doubt, a
principle infinitely inferior in dignity, for it is blind and
unintelligent, while design sees and understands, but this is not the
question. The question, superseded by an answer derived from human
experience, is to this effect&mdash;that nature and natural things are,
with no less propriety, assignable as the doers of a certain
non-designing kind of order, than man is assignable as the doer of the
designing kind; that we just as truly perceive that nature, in the
exercise of certain powers that we find to be inherent in her, produces
order in a dew-drop or in a crystal, as that man, in the exercise of
certain powers that we find to be inherent in him, produces order in a
poem or in a cathedral, and that, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23"
href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>consequently, the argument from
design, based as it is on the assertion that our experience assures us
of only one principle of order, is invalid.</p>
<p>Mr. F. W. Newman&rsquo;s argument is one of this erroneous class. He
points to &ldquo;Animal Instincts&rdquo; as an effect, which, owing to
our knowing of no other agency by which it could have been produced,
can alone be accounted for by reference to a designer, and consequently
as manifesting the objective existence of that designer, who could only
be the theistic God. The question that Mr. F. Newman&rsquo;s adduced
instance required him to consider was, whether the non-designing
principle of order, which, we are aware, is in many cases able to
produce the same effects as the other, could have been thus operative
here, and he had got to prove that it could <i>not</i> have been so,
that there was something in the nature of the case that forced us
exclusively to have recourse to the intelligent principle of order, and
resisted any solution from the other principle. The result of a proof
so conducted would have been, that Mr. F. Newman was entitled to
conclude that (granting our earthly experience was a sufficient test of
the matter) Design must have been the sole worker of the debated
phenomenon. He would then have established his theistic argument.
Instead of doing this, he simplifies his proceeding by being
incognisant of a notorious fact, and ignoring the non-designing
principle altogether.</p>
<p>1. The fact is, that there is <i>not</i> one way only of producing
the phenomena of design (I am here using an ordinary elliptical mode of
speaking, since literal metaphysical correctness is sometimes
cumbrous)&mdash;but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>there are two ways: one, the mind of a
designer, and the other (whatever may be its nature, which the present
question does not call upon me to define) <i>not</i> the mind of a
designer.</p>
<p>2. The shortest way of proving this theorem, is to state that there
are two ways of your obtaining a facsimile of your own person. One is
to have your portrait taken, and the other is to stand before a
looking-glass, and that of these two ways the former is that of design,
and the latter confessedly <i>not</i> design, being the well-known
necessary effect of certain so-called second causes, whose operation in
this instance is familiar to modern science.</p>
<p>3. Consequently, S. D. Collet is incorrect in the principle which
she makes the foundation of her argument at p. 27, where it is said,
&ldquo;What the Theist maintains is this, that when we see the exercise
of Force in the direction of a purpose, we, by an inevitable inference,
attribute the phenomenon to <i>some</i> conscious agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. Force is seen to be exercised in the direction of a
purpose&mdash;the purpose being that of producing similitude&mdash;with
equal evidence in the two cases just compared; for though the force
exercised in said direction is less in the case of the painter than it
is in that of the looking-glass (for the resemblance produced by the
former is in less degree a resemblance than that produced by the
latter), the <i>evidence</i> cannot be said to be less, since it is no
less able to convince. We are as perfectly sure that the painter could
not have produced that <i>lesser</i> similitude of a man, and a
particular man<span class="corr" id="xd21e363" title=
"Not in source">,</span> by chance (the alternative of this
supposition, according <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>to our experience, being that <i>he</i> must
have used design) as we are that the looking-glass could not have
produced that <i>greater</i> similitude of a man, and a particular man,
by chance (the alternative of this supposition, according to our
experience, being that <i>it</i> must have used certain so-called laws
of nature); this collective experience of ours, equally assuring us on
the one hand, that the only way of the painter&rsquo;s achieving these
effects is by design, and on the other, that the only way of the
looking-glass&rsquo;s doing so, is by the natural agencies referred
to.</p>
<p>5. The human experience on which the decision of this question must
be founded&mdash;though not at the present era <i>essentially</i>
different&mdash;may yet be said to be considerably so from what it was
in certain former periods. In no times could mankind think and observe
without becoming aware of these two principles of order&mdash;whether
you call them facts or inferences&mdash;as a portion of their familiar
experience. And so far as they might have compared them, they must have
abundantly seen that the natural one is more powerful than the
artificial one, and that the straight line or the circle must seek its
perfection much rather from the plummet or the revolving radius, than
from the pencil of Apelles.</p>
<p>6. Thus the <i>essential</i> point of the existence of the two
principles has always been known, but the idea of their respective
spheres and limits, of the efficient prevalence of each within our
experience, has fluctuated in society. Art and handicraft are, of
course, peculiarly competent to appreciate the artificial principle of
order, while physical science is especially conversant with the
<i>natural</i> one. As the ancients were equal to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>moderns
in the former pursuits, but vastly inferior to them in the latter, they
must so far have had a tendency to think more of the designing
principle, and less of the other principle than we do. But it must be
remembered, that one or other of these two principles, or at least the
arbitrament between them, is the animating basis of all religion, and
of all religious sects and persuasions; and further, that of these two
principles, the religion founded on the <i>artificial</i> one, which is
the one traditionally derived to us, is liable to be, and is wont to
be, a far more powerful religion (because it deals far more intensely
in personification, having reference singly to some supposed artist)
than either the religion that is constituted by the <i>natural</i>
principle, or that which results from a mixture of the two principles.
And indeed, I will incidentally say that this last kind of religion
seems to me to have much analogy on its side, and that the old idea of
&ldquo;the two principles&rdquo; might, on several grounds besides the
present one, and in several respects, perhaps, be found <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e400" title="Source: so">to</span> shadow forth a
certain amount of most important truth and applicability.</p>
<p>7. To return. By considering the state of religion and of religious
belief in the times of Socrates and Cicero, in connection with the
state of art, handicraft, and science, in the same time, and
coincidently taking care not to forget that religious sentiment (that
at least of the kind which had in their era already been, and much more
since has been, communicated from the east to the west) is an
incomparably more vigorous impeller of opinion, than reason and
argument; we shall have some of the principal data, and in a main
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>matter shall be prepared to use them judiciously
in any inquiry we might make, why it was that Socrates and Cicero,
having their attention arrested by the artificial principle of order
and arrangement, seemed absolutely to forget the existence of the
natural one, and why in consequence it was, that the latter wrote to
this effect: &ldquo;He who can look up to the heavenly vault, and doubt
the existence of a one personal God, the designer and governor of all
things, is equivalent to a madman&rdquo;; and why, further, we, spite
of our vast physical science, are prone to the same fallacy.</p>
<p>8. Having thus proved that the argument of the Theist generally, as
well as the particular one advanced by S. D. C. at p. 27, is, by being
based on the erroneous statement that there is <i>only one</i> means
known to human experience, of producing phenomena identical with those
that are the product of design, and that this one is design itself;
there being, on the contrary, <i>two</i> such means, one of which is
<i>not</i> design; having, I say, proved that your argument, by being
so based, is <i>invalid</i>, I find I must fully agree with you, that
there is evidence of &ldquo;an unmistakable cosmical unity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9. The true inquiry, therefore, is, which of those two principles of
order is, in the agency inquired into, the agent under these
circumstances, and whether both, and how far, under our ignorance of
what <i>may be</i> (a most important point that is carefully to be
considered) we are entitled to affirm as indubitable, to denounce as
contradictory, to advance as probable, to conjecture, to surmise, or to
speculate on this question. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=

<h2 class="main">THE TRUTH OF FIRST PRINCIPLES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. You ask &ldquo;my idea on the impossibility of
proving the truth of First Principles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By &ldquo;truth&rdquo; you mean the ascertained existence of any
idea or thing, and the ascertained consistency of any statement with
some such idea or thing.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;principles&rdquo; you mean not simply cardinal
propositions, but cardinal propositions that we have ascertained to be
true.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;first principles&rdquo; you mean the indubitably true but
unprovable elementary principles of all our knowledge. You mean that
these principles are the ground whereon we build in our reasonings; all
that we build upon them must, in consequence of being so built, admit
of being &ldquo;proved&rdquo; whether we have built rightly&mdash;that
is, admit of being subjected to the test whether the reasoning is
correct; but these &ldquo;first principles&rdquo; are confessedly
exempted from this test, and yet are received as true, no less than the
others that have sustained this ordeal. You ask the meaning of this
privilege, whether it is right; and, if so, to what propriety or
necessity of the case it is due?</p>
<p>2. You ask, &ldquo;How is truth ascertained to be truth?&rdquo; or,
in other words, &ldquo;What is the criterion of truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With respect to the first query&mdash;In accordance with the
definition I have above given of truth, it would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>seem
that it must have two sources, experience and reason, experience who
notifies the existence of certain ideas or things, and reason, who
forms propositions suggested by them. Experience, therefore, acts the
simple part of supplying all the materials of truth; while reason,
besides his acknowledged office of judge of all truth, exercises the
quite different function of being himself the purveyor of a portion of
it.</p>
<p>So indubitable is it that truth can have these two sources only,
that even fanaticism would be found confessing the principle; while it
appeals to the experience of those who agree with it, as well as
professes to be reasonable.</p>
<p>First principles must, accordingly, be of two kinds. Of those that
are based upon experience, I will give the following instances:&mdash;I
hear the chirping of a bird, and I see an inkstand before me. That I
have the sensation of hearing and seeing in these two cases, are facts
of which it is impossible I can doubt. Reason perceives that these are
primary facts or first principles, neither admitting nor requiring any
proof, testified by consciousness, and self-evidently verified on that
testimony.</p>
<p>By reason, of course is meant the reason of all mankind&mdash;that
is, of all who are presumably competent to judge on the subject. So
that any just or reasonable confidence in the verdict of my own
reason&mdash;in this or in any other matter, presupposes a due
comparison of my own reason with that of others, nay, in some cases, a
consideration of the supposably more enlightened reason of future
times. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>I discriminate first principles from derived ones
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;I see the sun,&rdquo; is a first principle to me;
&ldquo;you see it,&rdquo; is a first principle to you; by comparing
these two ideas, each attains the derived principle that the other sees
what he does, and the further derived principle that the sun is an
existence independent of both. His own existence is, indeed, to every
one the first principle, by means of which he infers the existence of
other things and beings.</p>
<p>In coming now to the other kind of first principles, consisting of
propositions formed by reason, we perceive that these show symptoms of
still further difference from the above, than that which results from
the difference of their source, of difference that affects their
philosophical character, and their technical right to the name under
which they present themselves to us. In short, the primary philosophy
has not yet settled their title.</p>
<p>They are perceived by us to be true by an act of reason called
intuition. Not similarly, however, does our reason inform us that they
really are first principles, and our science is hitherto unequal to
this inquiry.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the following celebrated thesis, so often cited
as the most fundamental of all the propositions of reason, insomuch as
to be tacitly implied in all our reasonings; which yet we are not sure
<i>is</i> a first principle, all that can be said in favor of its
pretensions being that we can find no one who is able to reduce it to
more primary elements:&mdash;</p>
<p>It is impossible for a thing at the same time to be and not to
be.</p>
<p>Any one agreeing, as every one must, that this is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>true,
might still justly put the query, Why is it impossible? thereby calling
its assertion in question, demanding its credentials of proof, seeking
some ground for its truth other than its own testimony, and
hypothesising some other proposition more fundamental than it of which
it would be a derivative, and by all and each of these proceedings,
rejecting its claim to be a first principle.</p>
<p>Its resisting our analysis is a good subjective ground for our
ranking this and other similar propositions among our first principles.
But they could only have the true claim by its being made clear that
the inability results from the nature of the case, and not from our own
incompetency.</p>
<p>This test is borne by the former description of first principles; we
are able to see that the instances I adduced, such as the statements,
&ldquo;I see the sun,&rdquo; &ldquo;I see an inkstand,&rdquo; &ldquo;I
hear a bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am conscious that <i>I</i> exist,&rdquo;
evade our power of ordinary proving, because they do not admit of such
proof.</p>
<p>When we perceive that no one can answer this query, we are prompted
to another. Why cannot we answer it? whence our inability? what
prevents us? But here also we find ourselves completely in the
dark<span class="corr" id="xd21e479" title="Source: ?">,</span> which
is somewhat strange, considering that in every human pursuit, whether
of science or any other, when we wish to do a thing and cannot do it,
we are generally able to specify some particular, either of self-defect
or outward impediment that is supposed to be in fault. But I imagine,
if the reader were to experiment on the specimen I have given, he would
not only find himself to fail in solving the problem, Why is it that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>a thing cannot at once be and not be? but would
not have a word to advance in the way of accounting for his
failure.</p>
<p>These remarks apply to all other propositions of the sort.
Euclid&rsquo;s axioms, which undoubtedly aim to be as elementary as
possible, and therefore may be said to aim to be first principles, are
confessedly, under this aspect, unsatisfactory to the learned.
&ldquo;Things that are equal to the same are equal to each
other.&rdquo; Every one is inclined to ask, Why? &ldquo;A straight line
is the shortest distance between two points.&rdquo; Again, Why?</p>
<p>The sum of the above strictures on this kind of so-called first
principles, is&mdash;1. That they have not made good their title, and
therefore are not to be accredited with it. 2. That there is a decided
presumption against that title from the doubt and dissatisfaction with
which it is met, where want of candor and intelligence cannot be
imputed, especially when it is considered that the other, the sensuous
experimental kind of first principles, have so frank an acceptance. 3.
It seems to be absolutely provable, and I suppose I have above
incidentally proved it, that they are <i>not</i> first principles. 4.
The task is set to metaphysics of supplying the most satisfactory proof
of all by bringing to light such propositions as would be perceived to
underlie these so-called first principles, and to be the real first
principles to which the others would give precedence.</p>
<p>As regards their name, it being so much in point, excuses the old
remark that the elements of our knowledge stand in a reversed order in
respect to this knowledge to what they assume in our process of
acquiring it. A first principle, therefore, means also a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>last
one; it is the last in whatsoever endeavors to descend to the bottom or
to penetrate to the source of our knowledge, but it becomes the first
when we trace it from this source through its derivative ideas.</p>
<p>The investigating act should not be confounded with the prospecting
one. The sensible horizon of subjective vision can, by no mediation, be
exalted into the real horizon of truth, wherein the genuine first
principles that bound human capability are exclusively to be found.</p>
<p>It may be asked, apart from the inquiry what first principles there
are, Is there a necessity that some first principles should be? So it
seems from the data of the case. It is patent to common observation
that the mind of man is recipient of ideas from the things that
surround it. The contact of its apprehending faculty with the things it
apprehends, must, it would seem, constitute first principles. After it
has got them it might conceivably elicit from them derived principles,
but the original ones cannot be thus derived, since there are none
earlier from which to derive them.</p>
<p>Again, it is to be inquired, Does the mind, in receiving its ideas,
possess and exercise in reference to the things on which it operates, a
copying faculty or a transforming faculty? Does it import them simply
in their native character, in the way a mirror does the object it
reflects, or does it manufacture, cook, and assimilate them, so as to
change them into something partaking of its own?</p>
<p>And, if it changes them, what is the extent of the change? Does it
go so far only as the semi-idealism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34"
href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>of Locke, or extend into the
absolute idealism of the German school?</p>
<p>Because these questions have been wont to puzzle either the learned,
or the public, or both, it does not follow that they are difficult. I
suppose them to admit of decided answers before a supposed competent
audience.</p>
<p>As I am unprovided with proof, although I suppose it is to be
provable, that first principles of reason must needs be, I must
speculate for a moment on the possibility of a proposition of the form
of &ldquo;two and two make four,&rdquo; being derived from one of the
form of &ldquo;I scent the rose,&rdquo; for this seems to be the
alternative of there being no first principles of reason. Evidently I
must confess to having no grounds for pronouncing such a derivation
impossible, though I must grant it to be paradoxical. Our
mal-cultivation of non-material science, and the imperfection of our
metaphysics, is probably the only cause of the strange predicament.</p>
<p>No doubt M. Cousin, and several other eminent teachers of youth, to
whose office it belongs to expound received metaphysics, have comprised
First Principles in their course of philosophy; but as I have barely
met with any of their writings, I must confess such an ignorance of
them, as not even to know how far I am either adopting, or evading
their phraseology, in discussing the same subjects. Mine, however,
cannot be wrong, since the term &ldquo;first principles,&rdquo; that I
have chosen, is one of familiar popular use; so that were this mode of
speech, as indeed it is, peculiarly liable to ambiguity, it would, for
that very reason, be preferable to any other, till such time as that
ambiguity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>should have been explained, and the wrong
thinking, of which it might have been the source, exposed and obviated.
Not till this had been done would it be time to inquire whether the
current metaphysics had invented any intrinsically better ways of
speaking on these topics, for though the veriest tyro in such
investigations would be justified in objecting to some of its
technicalities, such as the invention of the word free-will, for
instance, for the same reason that a beginner in zoology might object,
were such an attempt ever made, to the introduction of the word sphynx
or griffin into that branch of inquiry, there can be no doubt that
other of its speculations are more happily conceived. Hence I suppose
it would be a decided mistake to imagine, for example, that no
<i>trouve</i> whatever is to be elicited from the obscurities of Kant,
but on the other hand, one must as much take care to entertain sober
conjectures of the possible value of such unsunned treasures, as to
keep in mind that quackery may be not unqualified with some merit, and
I might surmise that it was perhaps in virtue of his fabulous
expectations in this direction, that Coleridge could not execute his
long-meditated plan of elucidating that writer; or rather,
perhaps&mdash;to speak more curtly&mdash;a spirit more differing from
that which compounded the amalgam, was necessary to resolve and detect
it.</p>
<p>According to this estimate of the value of our achieved studies, it
would be expectable, in regard to my present topic, that almost all the
materials for right conclusions on it must be extant somewhere or other
in our books, no great amount of ability being required <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>to turn
them to proper account: an easily suppliable desideratum being thus
left unsupplied, the public indifference manifested thereby would seem
to bear the ascription of our unsatisfactory metaphysics to the fault,
however apportioned between the many and the few, not of the intellect,
but of the reason.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is held as a pretty general rule, that where there is
want of reform, there is want of reason; and Bacon, by implication,
thought the rule here applicable, when, in defending his &ldquo;new
philosophy&rdquo; from the charge of arrogance, he apologised by saying
that a &ldquo;cripple in the right road would make better progress than
a racehorse in the wrong.&rdquo; That is, he claimed for himself, as he
was bound logically to do, the plain good sense of directing his
supposably humble faculties with an obvious regard to the end he
proposed and professed, and he was ready to concede to his competitors
all kinds of superiority but this.</p>
<p>The same simplicity characterises the reforming animus of the other
great patriarch of &ldquo;the new philosophy,&rdquo; in its sister
branch. The still debated point between the school of Locke and the old
philosophy was, and is, of such a form as may be figured by the
following hypothetical, and it may be, well-founded statement. Locke
seems to have battled mainly for the principle that ideas that every
one allows to be inferences, should be acknowledged by philosophy to be
such, while the adherents of the old ideas maintained, in opposition to
him, that ideas that every one allows to be inferences, should
<i>not</i> be acknowledged by philosophy to be such. Or, in other
words, Locke aimed to realise a certain first principle of reason,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>which I shall have hereafter to consider, which
stands thus:&mdash;&ldquo;That which it is,&rdquo; while his opponents
withstood this innovating pretension, finding it fatal to their
doctrine. If the reader is somewhat startled at the statement I have
just made, I will remind him that it amounts to nothing more than
saying that in the contest between the new and the old philosophy,
reason is entirely and absolutely on the side of the former, an
assertion which, of course, I must both think admits of being
substantiated, and must take myself, in some degree, to be able to aid
in its being so.</p>
<p>The existing quarrel between the two philosophies might, perhaps, be
personified through the medium of a principal champion on each side.
For the new ideas I could only choose Locke, since he is admitted to
have had no equally eminent successor; for the old I would choose M.
Cousin, both on account of his superior merit and popularity, and also
of his having made Locke the subject of some elaborate strictures that
I happen to have read. On these, when they come again to hand, I should
perhaps have something to remark; meanwhile I must content myself with
addressing myself to one of them in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>In antiquity and the middle ages, the schoolmaster and the
philosopher were one and the same individual. The new philosophy was
the first to separate these two departments; perceiving that the
communication of truth is a distinct office from its investigation, and
that that difference of office in each case necessitates a
corresponding difference in the public, that is the proper object of
its exercise. Since, moreover, society may be discriminated into two
sorts of mind, admitting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>of being pictured as the childish and
the adults, it is evident that the instructor must find his audience
more especially in the former, while the investigator of truth must
appeal exclusively to the latter. This he must needs do, to whichever
of the sciences he ministers; and not only so, but he must more
particularly address himself to a small and select portion of this
itself selecter class, constitute them the witnesses and judges of his
proceedings, and perceive that both his success in philosophy and the
acknowledgment of it can only be founded first and foremost on their
approbation. As even in jockeyism and prize-fighting, there are
&ldquo;the knowing ones,&rdquo; similar referees are, by the nature of
things, required for the flourishing estate of any science; and
evidently in proportion as they might be incompetent to such an office,
false or imperfect science must be the result.</p>
<p>Locke, acting on this instinctive view, communicated to the public
certain observations he had made in mental philosophy, and entitled his
work, <i>An Essay on the Human Understanding</i>. He properly called it
an essay, because a person who simply aims to investigate truth,
undertakes to do his best in the way of trial, endeavor, and
experiment, in such sort as to make the word essay appropriate to what
he does. The word moreover implies that the thing done, though it is
the writer&rsquo;s best, is liable to be incomplete, comparatively
imperfect, and, indeed, in the more difficult questions of philosophy,
as well as in the less advanced stages of philosophising, is sure to be
so. Locke accordingly, having had his attention struck with certain
phenomena of the human mind, told the public <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>just
what he had observed, and nothing else. Among the observations that he
thus imparted, was the process through which the mind seems to go in
arriving at the sum of its ideas, and especially the points from which
it seems to start in this process.</p>
<p>M. Cousin, having apparently no conception of a way of acting so
proper to legitimate inquiry, and having himself written a <i>Course of
Philosophy</i>, evidently thinks Locke ought to have done the same; for
he says that Locke is erroneous in the method of his philosophy, that
he begins at the wrong end, that instead of having told us as he has
how the ideas arise in the mind, he ought to have told us what the
ideas are, instead of describing their origin to have described their
actuality, to have given a list of the faculties of the mind, and so
on. Which is just the same thing as saying that a traveller who
publishes his explorations in America, ought instead to have gone to
China.</p>
<p>I shall have to make some objections to Locke, but they will be of a
nature exactly contrary to those of which he is usually made the
subject. Instead of accusing his principles I shall have to impute to
him the not sufficiently carrying them out; a fault due to his position
as an early reformer, and perfectly consistent with his high character
as such.</p>
<p>I have the more reason to note this distinction between M.
Cousin&rsquo;s department and the function exercised by Locke, because
I am forced myself to take the benefit of it. Want of erudition would
form very vulnerable points, were I to be judged by the former
standard. In the little I have yet put forth on the subject of First
Principles, I already find two or three <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>errors of that sort,
which a greater amount of reading would no doubt have enabled me to
escape. My present letter may close with some correction of one of
these.</p>
<p>Preliminary, I will venture to call &ldquo;That which is is,&rdquo;
a first principle of reason, and &ldquo;Two and two make four,&rdquo;
one of its derivatives, leaving this topic for future explanation, and
then proceed thus:&mdash;When in my last letter I represented first
principles as bounding the horizon of human knowledge, I left it to be
inferred that both the kinds of &ldquo;first principles&rdquo; I had
mentioned were thus describable in common. I find, however, that this
metaphysical character belongs exclusively to first principles of
sensuous experience, and no more belongs to first principles of reason
than to first principles of grammar, or to first principles of
rhetoric. That is, first principles of reason are merely the result of
one of those analytical inquiries in which we arrive at something
absolutely simple, and must there stop, just as in the science of
numbers we may thus arrive at unity.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Having long ago defined First Principles of sensuous experience, I
find there is a difficulty attached to the other kind of first
principles derived from the various use of the word reason&mdash;which
I will say betrayed me into a wrong inference in the concluding
paragraph of my last letter.</p>
<p>Locke, in the 17th chapter of his fourth book, confesses that this
word, in the proper use of the English language, is liable to bear
several senses. Due discrimination in such a case, and a cautious
avoidance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>of the dangers to which philosophy is exposed, and
has so amply incurred, from this kind of source might, above all, have
been, expected from Locke, since he was the first who inculcated it,
and is generally remarkable for the observance of his own precepts in
this matter. Hence the charge I have now got to bring against him is a
little surprising.</p>
<p>Indeed, it might be asserted that his position and circumstances do
not seem very readily to bear the entire responsibility of some of his
proceedings. Perhaps he might be characterised as a writer of somewhat
humorous idiosyncracy in respect to tendency to fixed ideas. His
lapses, indeed, are not many, but they are highly significant, as I
shall have occasion in more than one instance to show, and among these
must evidently be reckoned that I am now going to notice, since it
imports the wrong definition of a word of such cardinal meaning.</p>
<p>In defining the word reason, in its proper and specific sense
wherein it is used to denote a certain well-known quality of the human
mind&mdash;that is, as approvedly ascertained and appreciated under
this name, as are certain weights and measures under those of pound,
gallon, or mile, he assigns a meaning to it that comes short of the
proportions thus justly prefigured as belonging to it. He confounds
reason with reasoning&mdash;that is, he emerges the entire faculty or
<i>modus operandi</i>, to which we give the name of reason, in that
partial exercise of its function to which we give the name of
reasoning. He says that, in matters of certainty, such as the proof of
any of Euclid&rsquo;s theorems, the acts by which the mind ascertains
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>fit coherence of the several links in the chain of
reasoning are acts of reason. Granted.</p>
<p>Also, that in weighing probabilities, a similar coherence is
similarly verified by reason. Granted&mdash;with liberty of comment
that these arts of reason, in either of the two cases have, by the
approved practice of language, received the name of reasoning.</p>
<p>But he further signifies&mdash;that is, he does not expressly
affirm, but, with equivalent certification, he implicitly asserts, and
inferentially states that, in examining such a proposition as the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;What is, is&rdquo; (an examination to which
confessedly no reasoning is attached), the act by which the mind
assents to the truth of this statement is not to be described as an act
of reason. He adopts a different phraseology, and calls it
intuition.</p>
<p>Observe, my objection is not that he invests the idea with this new
name, but that he disparages its old one. I do not object to your
calling a spade a shovel, under a certain view of its use, but it
remains still necessary that you should admit that a spade is, in the
full sense of the word, a spade.</p>
<p>Indeed, I will incidentally remark that I suspect the word
&ldquo;intuition&rdquo; has been a very good addition to our
vocabulary, and I suppose its proper import might be represented as
follows:&mdash;Reason has two modes of his exercise, the one is called
reasoning, and the other intuition. Intuition is the decision of reason
on one single point; reasoning&mdash;a word proper to demonstrative
truth&mdash;seems to be nothing more than intuition looking not merely
at one point, but at several points successively. So that intuition and
reasoning would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>constitute the self-same function of reason, and
the difference in their meanings would be solely owing to the
difference in the circumstances under which that function is
exercised.</p>
<p>Observe, that I am here only venturing to speculate, and am now
returning from that digression.</p>
<p>Whether or not Locke is herein psychologically consistent with
himself; whether, indeed, his real theory is not that which I have just
conjecturally intimated, is another question, which I shall defer to a
future occasion; but whether or not he herein opposes the ordinary,
prevailing, and inveterate use of language, which is what I am charging
him with doing, and whether or not he has justifiable ground for this
innovation which I am denying that he has, are points that must be
tried by the ordeal of these three considerations. How are we
accustomed to speak? How are we accustomed to write? and what sort of a
call for changing our customs in either of these particulars is that
which constitutes a genuine call to do so?</p>
<p>In regard to the first of these tests, the literature of all sects
and parties has been accustomed to assert that, both in matters of
science and of worldly business, reason is the judge of all truth
whatever, without exception.</p>
<p>Locke, on the other hand, informs us that reason is the judge of
demonstrative truth, of logical truth, of casuistical truth, and of
lawyers&rsquo; truth, and of these kinds of truth alone, but is
<i>not</i> the judge of intuitive or self-evident truth. Our writers
would tell us that to deny &ldquo;what is, is&rdquo; to be a true
statement, would be an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>offence against reason; but we learn from
Locke that reason has no cognisance in this matter, but intuition only
has, and consequently that the wrong committed would not be against
reason, but against intuition.</p>
<p>Our current speech accords with our literature in this view of the
meaning of the word reason; whose efficiency, moreover, it endeavors to
amplify, by surrounding it with satellites of adjectives formed from
it, the principal of which are &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unreasonable.&rdquo; Provided with this vocabulary, we pronounce
it to be unreasonable to deny any truth whatever that can be well and
clearly ascertained; and so far are we from reserving these adjectives
for the occasion of demonstrative truth, and holding them inapplicable
where self-evident or intuitive truth comes on the carpet, that we
account it, if possible, still more unreasonable to deny the latter
than the former.</p>
<p>But if the nomenclature adopted by Locke be the right one, there
ought to be a change in these current modes of speaking and writing.
One who should reject the proofs of Euclid, would be unreasonable; one
who should maintain that Thurtel or Greenacre were innocent of murder,
would be unreasonable; but, one who should deny the truth of any
self-evident proposition, would not be unreasonable; for to say this,
would be to say that reason has cognisance of such propositions,
whereas, according to him, it is expressly <i>not</i> reason, but
intuition that takes this office. The words &ldquo;intuitional&rdquo;
and &ldquo;unintuitional,&rdquo; must be invented to supply the obvious
need which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>apparent gap discovers; there seems no other way
of supplying it.</p>
<p>Lest I should be suspected of somewhat making up a case; of having,
perhaps, represented not so much what Locke really means, as what he
seems to mean, I will remind the reader that Locke is undertaking the
formal definition of a word, and that on such a critical occasion, it
is proper to give him credit for not meaning otherwise than he seems to
mean.</p>
<p>The passage which is my text, will be found in the earlier part of
the seventeenth chapter of the fourth book. Indeed, I could at once
prove my indictment by citing a few words from it, accompanied by a
comment of my own, had I any right to impose on the reader a belief in
the discriminating fairness and matter-of-fact accuracy, both of my
extracts and my comment.</p>
<p>I will, however, venture on such a step; I will suppose myself
commenting on this passage, and proceed thus: Locke, it will be seen in
this, his foremost and professed definition of the word reason,
contrasts it with &ldquo;sense and intuition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether he holds these to be identical with what he calls &ldquo;the
outward and the inward sense,&rdquo; is not quite clear. That, however,
is not the question.</p>
<p>He says, that these two faculties &ldquo;reach but a very little
way&rdquo;; for that &ldquo;the greatest part of our knowledge depends
upon deductions and intermediate ideas.&rdquo; Now, reason, he says,
may be defined to be that faculty, whose specific office it is
&ldquo;to find out and apply&rdquo; those intermediate ideas and
deductions by which we obtain knowledge that consists of two kinds,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>one that which exalts us into
&ldquo;certainty,&rdquo; the other that which, though less generous
diet for the mind, we have constantly good ground for gladly
acquiescing in, and which we call &ldquo;probability.&rdquo; So that,
says Locke, if you ask, &ldquo;What room is there for the exercise of
any other faculty but outward sense and inward perception?&rdquo; I can
abundantly reply, &ldquo;Very much.&rdquo; I have shown you that
without this &ldquo;demonstrative&rdquo; faculty, our knowledge would
be but a skeleton; it would, indeed, not be properly speaking
knowledge, but mere rudiments of knowledge.</p>
<p>Such is my interpretation of Locke&rsquo;s definition of reason, in
the proper and specific sense of this word. If it is strictly correct,
as I believe the intelligent reader will find by reference, then it is
Locke confounds reason with reasoning, mistakes a part for the whole,
and the whole for a part, and acts similarly&mdash;to borrow his own
way of illustration&mdash;to the representing a gallon to be a quart,
or a half-sovereign to be a sovereign.</p>
<p>It is to be observed, too, that it is entirely in behalf of the more
showy kind of knowledge, that the mistake is made. The respected name
of reason is given exclusively to logic and demonstrating. Good sense,
good feeling, just instinct, if they stand alone, have no claim to it;
they are put on an inferior footing; true, they are intuition; but what
then? they are not reason.</p>
<p>Now, the century introduced by Locke is accused by the present, and
it is generally admitted, with some degree of justice, of having
&ldquo;materialistic&rdquo; tendencies. We may see, then, how
Locke&rsquo;s doctrine, as just <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>described, founded though it is
only on nomenclature, hinging merely on definition, incurring whatever
wrongness it implicates from no other lapse than that of confounding a
word with its derivative, doing nothing, in short, but annul the
difference of meaning between the two words, reason and reasoning; we
may see how this apparently harmless experiment might tend to supplying
these materialistic tendencies with a ground, a rationale, a principle,
and thus to exalt their authority, and how, indeed! it just smacks of
their spirit.</p>
<p>It may be seen, too, how, from a few slips, such as this on the part
of the champion of the &ldquo;new philosophy,&rdquo; competing schools
of the present age might be able to make up a case, specious enough to
gain the acquiescence of a portion of the public against
both&mdash;with how great futility, I believe, would appear, if the
accusations were weighed by a competent tribunal.</p>
<p>And, finally, it might be expected, that the undue exaltation of the
demonstrative department of reason, should issue in a reaction into a
contrary extreme, and that some Mr. Carlyle might be found to inveigh
against &ldquo;logic,&rdquo; to sneer at &ldquo;analysis,&rdquo; to
denounce &ldquo;cause and effect philosophy&rdquo; and to praise
&ldquo;mysticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have already assumed that the third test that I promised, goes
against Locke, and requires no examination, simply because he has not
advanced it in his behalf. He has assigned no ground for changing the
meaning of the word reason, and it is presumable that none is
assignable.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>The question, What is the Criterion of Truth?&mdash;that is, What
are the proper means of distinguishing whether anything that is
asserted to be true is so or not? claims immediate notice, because such
a criterion exists, and the new philosophy necessarily appeals to it
when it comes before the public, while it has shown with what effect it
can do so, in the case of those of its branches&mdash;namely, the
purely material and the mathematical, that flourish in society.</p>
<p>Premising that it is a way of certifying truth that has been
immemorially used by mankind in their daily affairs, and which they
have always, to some extent, instinctively transferred to their
judgments in philosophy, and that it is the only possible general and
summary criterion of truth, I may describe it as consisting in the
unanimous assent to some idea or assertion of all who are thought
competent to pronounce concerning it.</p>
<p>Viewed in connection with the thing it verifies, and the parties who
use it, the criterion may be thus represented: Any idea, assertion, or
opinion, must, by any inquirer, be found true, when he perceives it to
be such as would be unanimously assented to by all presumably competent
judges of the kind of truth to which it refers.</p>
<p>So that those who use this criterion, and are convinced of the truth
of anything through its medium&mdash;a proceeding which I have
represented as common and habitual to mankind&mdash;in thereby
pronouncing certain supposed persons to be judges of truth in the said
matter, claim themselves to be also judges of it in the matter of so
pronouncing. The acts of judgment they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>thus tacitly challenge to
themselves may be said to be to the following effect:&mdash;1. They
assign the qualifications that constitute competency for a certain
function. 2. They decide that there are persons in the community
answering to this character. 3. They opine that the view such persons
take or would take, imports an assertion of the truth of the idea in
question. 4. They accredit that view with being strictly one, supposing
that all qualified to arbitrate would acquiesce and agree in the same.
5. They attribute to themselves a similar unanimity. 6. They assume the
sufficiency of their own judgment to make all the above
conclusions.</p>
<p>These assumptions on their part, so complicated in description, are
simple enough in performance. It is plain that mankind&mdash;more
properly here to be called the public&mdash;simply attach themselves to
some opinion which they find current in society; while, however, the
assumptions I have just described are, in their full measure, but a
necessary consequence of their so doing, doubtless their so doing must
itself have been dictated by some kind of anticipation of them, but
this may, to any degree, have been vague, undetermined, partial, and
imperfect.</p>
<p>The rationale of this double bench of judges is thus explained. In
reference to almost every kind of truth there is always a certain
portion of the community better able to judge than the rest. Hence it
becomes clearly the part of the latter, if they wish to be rightly
informed, to defer to the opinion of those confessedly better
judges&mdash;confessed to be such from the general opinion to that
effect. Thus a second set of judges <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50"
href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>perforce, in addition to those
that were originally conceived by choice, is implicated in this
transaction.</p>
<p>For the primary sort I must seek a name from the French language,
which calls them &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; the English supplying, I
believe, none, except a very vernacular one, the &ldquo;knowing
ones&rdquo;; the others have already got a well-known name&mdash;the
public.</p>
<p>The public, in deciding on the occasions in question, what are the
qualifications that constitute &ldquo;experts&rdquo; may be said to
<i>choose</i> them, thereby, however, choosing persons in idea, and not
bodily. The relation of the public to these conceptions of theirs is
the same as that of the constituencies to the members of Parliament, in
the point of one being the choosers and the others the chosen, with a
common object in view.</p>
<p>I suppose, to stop the current of my discourse, and adjourn its
topic, for the sake of at once bringing the general principle discussed
to the test of exemplification, would have its want of logical harmony
excused by its being desiderated by the reader.</p>
<p>I had undertaken to prove that this principle&mdash;which, for
distinction&rsquo;s sake, I will call the unanimity principle&mdash;is
the proper and only criterion of scientific truth to the great
non-scientific world, and consequently that modern philosophy
necessarily appeals to it when it comes before the public. What I had
thus taken upon myself to do, obviously was&mdash;first, to display and
explicate the principle by definition, and this I had already done; and
next&mdash;to describe it theoretically by showing its manner of
existing, and this I was engaged in doing. Leaving this inquiry in the
midst, I am now going to deviate into the practical phase of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>its description, by showing, not how it <i>is</i>,
but how it <i>acts</i>. This seems necessary for the satisfaction of
the reader, as being the only way of securing him from any, even were
it but temporary, misapprehension as to the working value of the
principle for which his attention is demanded. I therefore select the
six following examples, the two first homely, and the four last
philosophical, of its ordinary use by the public.</p>
<p>They will be at once seen to justify my assertion of its having for
its main characteristics the two facts&mdash;<i>first</i>, that mankind
habitually use it, and have always done so; and <i>next</i>, that
propositions thus warranted are universally accepted as established
truth, and that no one thinks of calling them in question.</p>
<p>1. Thus no one doubts, when coming to the intersection of two roads,
he sees a sign-post, on one of whose pointers is written &ldquo;To
London,&rdquo; and on the other &ldquo;To Windsor,&rdquo; no one
hesitates to believe that the information thus conveyed to him is true;
because he is aware that those who give it are competent to do so, and
that none similarly competent will gainsay it.</p>
<p>2. Again, no one doubts that the sun rises and sets once in every
twenty-four hours; no one doubts that he so rose and set yesterday.
Every one is ready to affirm the certainty of these two facts, but very
few can do so, in any great degree, from their own experience; but they
help the lack of this by that of their neighbors. Neither is it
necessary that they should have any near, nor even the most remote,
idea of the personality of those on whose testimony they thus
implicitly rely; it suffices they are sure, whoever they may be, they
have the right qualifications for testifying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>in the
way they do, and that no one so qualified can contradict their
evidence, or dream of doing so.</p>
<p>The above are examples of the criterion of truth, applied to the
ideas and proceedings of ordinary life. It will be seen therefrom,
<i>first</i> that mankind have in all ages been educated in an
acceptance of its principle, according to my definition of it, the
principle, namely, of an indubitable certainty of truth, resulting from
the unanimous assent to some idea of all who are thought by self and
neighbors competent to pronounce thereon; possibly too they may be said
to have been educated in some imperfect theoretical appreciation of
this principle.</p>
<p>It will <i>secondly</i> be seen therefrom, that the two kinds of
unanimity which I have predicated as essential to the proper use and
results of this criterion, an unanimity, namely, on the part of the
supposed good judges of certain descriptions of truth, who may be
called the adepts or knowing ones imagined by the public; and again an
unanimity on the part of the public itself in interpreting and adopting
their opinion; it will be seen, I say, that this double unanimity is
perfectly attainable, nay, perfectly attained, and that too so
extensively, as to constitute a common and familiar occurrence on all
manner of occasions of daily life.</p>
<p>I will now give instances of their similar use of it in directing
their judgments on philosophical questions.</p>
<p>3. Very few of the public are able to examine the proof of any of
the theorems of Euclid, yet there is none of them who would think of
seriously doubting the truth of anything contained in that book, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>ground of their confidence being solely their
knowledge of the fact, that the learned in these matters have
unanimously so decided.</p>
<p>Every one, again, believes in certain facts that are asserted by
navigators, explorers, and geographers, respecting the existence,
position, and products of various countries of the globe. Every one,
further, believes in certain deductions derived from these facts by
naturalists, geologists, astronomers, and so forth. The belief is owing
to the unanimous testimony of all these confessedly competent
authorities; but whenever they are seen to differ among themselves, the
public withholds its entire belief, and either doubts or disbelieves
the things asserted. Thus the public is at this day doubtful and
divided whether there is such a creature as the sea-serpent. Similarly
the public is dubious&mdash;for it must needs be so if any section of
it is so&mdash;whether a certain explorer who was authoritatively sent
out about a dozen years ago conjointly by the French Government and
Institute, was, in any degree, justified in bringing home the account
he did of there being a tribe of men in the interior of Africa having
tails, whether this unexpected information is, in any important
particular, true.</p>
<p>The two last examples have been furnished by material science. I
will now draw one from the other department, with the view of
indicating that in non-material science also, numerous propositions
circulate among the public that are franked by the same principle to
pass as undoubted truth. Such is the maxim of heathen philosophy,
recorded by Cicero in his &ldquo;Officiis&rdquo;: &ldquo;Do not to
another what you would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54"
name="pb54">54</a>]</span>not he should do to you&rdquo;; or the same
maxim, in its modified form, as given in the New Testament, with the
characteristic omission of the negative. The truth of this moral maxim
is universally admitted, because it is supposed that no person of
presumable moral judgment has ever been known to call it in
question.</p>
<p>It would seem, then, that this criterion of truth is&mdash;what
confessedly, or from easy proof, it is predicable that no other
criterion of truth is&mdash;a <i>general</i> criterion of truth. I
will, however, restrict this pretension to the statement&mdash;to be
hereafter more largely explained&mdash;that it is a general criterion
of truth to the public as such, to the public considered as a public;
for, indeed, it is not properly <span class="corr" id="xd21e715" title=
"Source: useable">usable</span> at all by anyone except in the
character of a member of the public. This means that it is a general
criterion of truth in the following way: it is applicable to the
verification of all truth, so far as it admits of being verified before
the public, and made the common property of the community.</p>
<p>6. For even where at first sight you might think it most out of
place, I mean in relation to that kind of truth whose primary evidence
is the consciousness of the individual, so that the competent witness
of truth is necessarily but one person, there is oneness of opinion,
there is unanimity, and the testimony of the one competent witness is
not contradicted or doubted by that of any other presumably competent.
When, for instance, I am conscious of the sensation of seeing an
inkstand before me, no one seeing reason to doubt my assertion to that
effect, all presumably competent testimony on the subject must needs be
concentrated in myself; and the fact of my seeing an inkstand,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>though for my own conviction verified in a way
independent of any such argument, is, for the conviction of others,
only pronounceable as true, because all presumably competent authority
is of one mind in alleging its truth.</p>
<p>In thus far exemplifying the use of this principle, I have exhibited
it in the exercise of its primary office only, which, however, is not
that which, on behalf of philosophy, I am here demanding from it. I
have shown it, namely, as used by the public to establish truth
positively, and not in the way wherein it may be used to distinguish
truth comparatively.</p>
<p>But it is solely in this latter office that it becomes a criterion
of truth, an arbiter between the true and the false, an indicator of
both, and more especially of what has the character of ascertained
truth, and what has not; and this, it will be remembered, was the
office I sought from it, and constituted the ultimate purpose of my
taking up the consideration of the subject.</p>
<p>Having with as much brevity as just suffices for that purpose,
explained the nature of the principle in question, and its use by
society at large, it now only remains that I should explain that
purpose itself, by theory and example.</p>
<p>What I am doing in tracing the unanimity principle from its first
instinctive use by the public to its secondary and meditated one by
philosophy, is a purely critical act, comparable to that of the
rhetorician who appreciates the character of certain modes of thinking
which have long since been practised by mankind, and shows what therein
is approvable&mdash;all the rest being liable to censure. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was the universal conviction of European Christendom, during many
centuries, that the Church, which was popularly supposed to be
represented by the Pope, enjoyed peculiarly a divine guidance which
made it an infallible judge of truth. This idea was thought to be
warranted by the unanimous assent of all right-minded persons, and the
denial of it to be the mark of a reprobate spirit, as well as contrary
to common sense. We now know the entire futility of this assumption,
and that the heretics were not inferior to the orthodox in the power of
judging such subjects. Hence in discussing the unanimity principle the
question presents itself, How came the public thus wrongly to apply it?
What error did they commit in so doing? When the revival of learning
and the consequent rise of Protestantism had exposed the error in that
form of it, it was still continued under the new social regimes; so
that even Locke, the boldest advocate of the rights of man that was
tolerated even in his time, stigmatised the dissentients from certain
Protestant tenets in the same unjust way that Popery had done to the
dissentients from certain Popish ones; speaking of them in two or three
places of his essay as persons at once notoriously disreputable in
character and weak in intellect; consistently with which estimate he
came to the conclusion that the reigning theology was established
truth, as being accredited by all those whose opinion was worth taking
account of.</p>
<p>Later times have again manifested the futility of the assumption
against the new race of dissentients. No one will say that <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e736" title="Source: Go&euml;the">Goethe</span> and
Neibuhr (to mention only two) must count for nothing on questions
wherein they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>were as likely to be well informed as their
opponents. So that Locke&rsquo;s side, instead of being warranted by
the decisive verdict he imagines, is but one of two suitors in an
undetermined cause, neither having yet attracted the votes of the whole
jury, and neither consequently yet occupying the position of
ascertained truth. Giving everyone a fair hearing is that trial and
test of competency which yields the only means of learning who said
competent judges are.</p>
<p>A little consideration, even in Locke&rsquo;s time of less advanced
thought, might have informed an intelligent mind, if free from
prejudice, that mere prohibitory laws must be of themselves less
adverse to the free expression of people&rsquo;s sentiments than that
averted state of the public mind of which they are one of the symptoms.
Both from theory and experience we may collect that very much the same
laws of supply and demand obtain in matters of opinion as in those of
food and raiment; the tongue and the pen, and the previous thought by
which these are instructed, must evidently hold back from offering to
the public, nay, in a great measure from suggesting to the agent
himself, any such ideas as they know the public will not, and must
confine themselves to putting forth such only as they suppose it will
understand, appreciate, and regard. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"

<h2 class="main">THE RIGHTS OF REASON.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To the two queries you put to me, &ldquo;What are
first principles?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is the criterion of
truth?&rdquo; I find it suitable to append some preliminary remarks on
&ldquo;The Rights of Reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solution you expect is, I presume, a reasonable one. You do not
wish me to take into account any opinions that cannot bear the test of
reason.</p>
<p>Your queries derive their greatest pertinency from the state of
non-material philosophy; and, possibly, might have been, in some
measure, prompted by this consideration. That double-minded way of
inquiring into truth, which only in part reasons, while it in part
dogmatises, imagines, and assumes, is, it is obvious, in morals,
metaphysics, and religion, one of our inheritances from former times.
The battle has been won in the material department, but is still
undecided on the other wing.</p>
<p>What, then, is Reason, and what are its Rights?</p>
<p>Every human inquiry that asks, What is right, proper, or correct?
necessarily, in doing so, asks, What is it reasonable to think,
believe, or do? in the points inquired into. The faculty&mdash;whatever
may be its nature&mdash;whereby we find ourselves able, under certain
circumstances, to answer this question, we call reason. The rights of
reason may be said to consist in the concession <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>to it of
a certain absolute power in the decision of truth, divisible under two
heads thus&mdash;a power of deciding what are the questions whereon it
is able to decide, and a power of deciding those questions.</p>
<p>One of the many ways of disparaging the rights of reason
is&mdash;openly or covertly to doubt or deny that morals, metaphysics,
and religion, are&mdash;in the full sense of the word&mdash;sciences.
This is to withdraw them from the empire of reason, and to hand them
over to some rival pretender.</p>
<p>No science can flourish while it is understood that its discussion
must be made palatable to the public. In any supposable code of the
rights of reason, one primary article would limit and define the
functions of the public in the investigation of truth&mdash;a topic
which, together with the kindred inquiry, Who are the public? is
suggested by your second query.</p>
<p>Mankind have naturally a degree of antipathy for reason. They have
found Reason, in the work he affects, dull, in the help he furnishes,
deficient, in the truth he unveils, ugly, in the rule he arrogates,
imperious. Barbarism, in all its stages, may be said to be founded, not
merely on ignorance, but on a state of the inclinations that revolts
from reason.</p>
<p>Two competitors have always disputed the rights of reason; authority
or precedent, and faith or conscience. Conscience, early or late, must
receive almost all his light from authority; and, therefore, in respect
to opinion, may generally be called the creature of authority. Yet, in
a moral aspect, authority is confessedly of no account, and conscience
has a sole jurisdiction. A large portion of mankind have, in our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>times, outgrown the error of resting their sense
of duty on the mere dictate of other men. The only legitimate directors
of human conduct are now generally admitted to be conscience and
reason; the conscience must be exclusively one&rsquo;s own, but the
reason need not entirely&mdash;and, indeed, cannot in any great
proportion&mdash;be one&rsquo;s own, but may be partly that of
one&rsquo;s neighbor.</p>
<p>The question of the division of power between these two potentates,
though not yet understood by the public, does not seem to be more
complicated than that analogous one just alluded to, and of which they
evidently understand the gist.</p>
<p>For authority, as above intimated, though the venerable instructor
of conscience, is yet morally subjected to him; and, not dissimilarly,
have conscience and reason reciprocal claims of precedence on each
other. Reason is the judge, but he is bound, under conscience, to give
a sufficient and attentive hearing to any pleadings that conscience may
have to offer, and conscience is the pleader, but he is bound, under
reason, to conform to whatever verdicts reason declares himself
competent to render.</p>
<p>If history in this particular can be considered as having disclosed
a necessary sequence, civilisation progresses in the following
order:&mdash;The general mind, in becoming acquainted with its own
powers, first learns an evolution of conscience (and this can only take
place through the medium of religion), and last learns to appreciate
reason (and this can only happen through the medium of science). While
the prerogatives of conscience were insufficiently known, authority
usurped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>them, and while the prerogatives of reason are
insufficiently known, authority and conscience conjointly usurp
them.</p>
<p>The word conscience I here use in its proper sense, wherein it means
either an individual conscience, or the united consciences of more than
one supposed to be in accord together, so as to make the acts resulting
from this accord constitute single acts of conscience. But the word has
taken an improper enlargement of meaning in being often used to signify
one conscience claiming something in contravention of another
conscience. These two, so different meanings of the word conscience,
are seldom duly discriminated by those who use them.</p>
<p>To the rights of reason belongs a certain degree of power, both in
regulating the individual conscience, and in solving the differences
between opposing ones. Under what conditions, and how far, reason can
exercise this office, and what rule he is to follow in so doing, would
be an inquiry suggested by my answer to your second query.</p>
<p>Having above mentioned religion and science as the two prime
ministers respectively of conscience and reason, I will pursue the
subject a little further.</p>
<p>Religion has aimed to have a moral animus by means of a free
conscience. Religion has not yet immediately aimed at moral conduct;
but, indeed, has been wont, by the mouth of her most strenuous
ministers, to assume that the aim at this is already included in that
other aim. But a moral animus is but one ingredient in moral conduct,
involving the intent only to act morally, without having of itself
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>the least power to realise that intent.
Knowledge,&mdash;that is, science, exclusively keeps the keys of this
power. Such knowledge religion has not yet made one of her aims and
ends either directly, or by any coalition with those who have so aimed.
Accordingly religion cannot be said hitherto to have been an advocate
of the rights of reason. Whatever good things she may have achieved in
this cause have been incidental to her advocacy of the Rights of
Conscience. Here reason was her weapon (sharpened for this use, and so
far valued and treasured), against authority. Her tendency meanwhile,
is to impel conscience to infringe on the rights of reason.</p>
<p>Science alone has hitherto been the immediate champion of these
rights. But it seems he cannot expect to make that advocacy complete
and effectual till he allies himself with religion. This alliance,
since it is persuaded by reason, and not by passion, can have science
alone for its real mover.</p>
<p>The Rights of Reason may at present be said to be in such a germ of
their acknowledgment as were the rights of conscience three centuries
ago. Mankind have not hitherto come to acquiesce in the idea of that
parsimony of guidance vouchsafed to man, which is found to be the
result of claiming for reason the power of calling all human thoughts
before his tribunal, and seeing whether he has anything to object to
them. Their idea has been that not only suggesting
inspiration&mdash;(which it does not seem necessary that the advocate
of the rights of reason should deny)&mdash;but guiding inspiration is
given, given too to some rather than to others, and given in such a
quality, as to dispense with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>the supervision of reason. A
generation successive to many among whom this doctrine has been taught
and believed, will not be prone to any decided rejection of it. Pride
of species inclining to exaggerated human pretensions above other
earthly creatures, and party pride inclining to exalt self and an
associated confraternity into a superiority over the rest of mankind,
and supplied with a traditional store of modes of thought and practice
adapted to such exclusive pretensions, and other native tendencies of
the human mind, persuade in the same direction.</p>
<p>I have thought it suitable to premise this short sketch of the
Rights of Reason, and the opponents of them, to an endeavor to answer
your queries in a thoroughly reasonable way, a way which cannot be said
to be the more fashionable one in the treatment of metaphysical
questions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
